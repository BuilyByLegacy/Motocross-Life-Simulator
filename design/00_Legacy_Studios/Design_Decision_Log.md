# Design Decision Log

This log captures decisions made during planning so the reasoning is not lost.

## DD-0001 - Information Visibility
**Decision:** Child players only know what children would realistically know.  
**Reason:** Reinforces immersion and the growing-up philosophy.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0002 - Meaningful Events Become Memories
**Decision:** Every meaningful event becomes a memory.  
**Reason:** Memories drive dialogue, relationships, recaps, documentary, garage objects, and future opportunities.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0003 - Object Memories
**Decision:** Objects remember their history.  
**Reason:** Bikes, helmets, trophies, tools, and trailers become emotionally meaningful instead of disposable inventory.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0004 - Place Memories
**Decision:** Places remember their history.  
**Reason:** Garages, tracks, training facilities, and family spots become part of the player's life story.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0005 - Garage Ownership
**Decision:** Parents own the garage/shop until adulthood. Ownership and responsibility transfer naturally over time.  
**Reason:** Supports the progression from childhood dependence to adult independence.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0006 - Factory Parts
**Decision:** Factory parts are best-in-class and good across performance categories, but require expert setup to reach their full potential.  
**Reason:** Keeps factory equipment aspirational while rewarding knowledge, mechanics, and team support.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0007 - Garage as Home
**Decision:** The garage is the player's home, workshop, museum, storage space, and social hub, not a static menu.  
**Reason:** The garage is the soul of the game and should visually tell the player's story.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0008 - Unique Careers
**Decision:** Every career should tell a unique story.  
**Reason:** Replayability comes from different lives, not simply different builds.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0009 - Living World
**Decision:** The world evolves independently of the player.  
**Reason:** The player should feel like they live in a motocross community, not a world built only around them.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0010 - Stories Over Statistics
**Decision:** The game should create stories, not just statistics.  
**Reason:** Long-term player attachment comes from memories, relationships, and meaningful events.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0011 - Asset Identity
**Decision:** Every important physical object has an Asset ID, serial number, ownership history, provenance, and memory history.  
**Reason:** Supports marketplace, collecting, resale, heirlooms, and object memories.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0012 - Separate Campaigns
**Decision:** Rider Mode and Parent Mode are separate campaigns.  
**Reason:** Each role has a different information set, emotional lens, UI, and responsibilities.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0013 - Consistent Career Pace
**Decision:** Childhood seasons do not progress faster than teenage or pro seasons.  
**Reason:** Childhood is emotionally important and should not be treated as a short tutorial.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0014 - Career Support Ladder
**Decision:** Career progression includes realistic support tiers: Family Supported -> Local Shop Rider -> Dealer Supported -> Manufacturer Amateur Team -> Factory Amateur -> Professional Privateer -> Factory Professional.  
**Reason:** Real motocross support is not simply local vs factory.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0015 - Lifestyle as Strategy
**Decision:** Lifestyle choices such as house, camper, training facility, backyard track, and private facility are strategic life decisions, not cosmetic choices.  
**Reason:** Where and how a family lives changes training, money, stress, relationships, and opportunities.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0016 - No NPC Language
**Decision:** Internally, avoid calling characters NPCs. Use People.  
**Reason:** Reinforces the philosophy that every character has goals, memories, relationships, and life outside the player.  
**Status:** Proposed

## DD-0017 - Story Engine Philosophy
**Decision:** The Story Engine should not ask, "What happens next?" It should ask, "Given everything that has happened so far, what is the most believable thing that could happen next?"  
**Reason:** Separates life simulation from scripted career mode.  
**Status:** Locked

## DD-0018 - Multiplayer Direction
**Decision:** Multiplayer should be asynchronous and story-sharing focused, not synchronous MMO-style career progression.  
**Reason:** Players progress at different speeds, and the core experience depends on personal pacing.  
**Status:** Proposed

## DD-0019 - Prototype Technology Stack
**Decision:** The v0.1 playable prototype is built as a zero-dependency, browser-based simulation in vanilla HTML/CSS/ES modules. No build step, no framework, no install — it runs from a static host or a local `python3 -m http.server`.  
**Reason:** The first prototype's job is to prove the *feel* (memories, family pressure, marketplace, race consequences, recap), not the rendering tech. Vanilla ES modules keep the engine architecture (event bus, Memory/Relationship/World/Story/Opportunity engines) clean and readable, run anywhere, and are trivial to share for playtesting. Engine choice for a full game (e.g. Godot/Unity) remains an open technical decision.  
**Status:** Proposed

## DD-0020 - Simulation Depth Levels
**Decision:** The game supports selectable **Simulation Depth**, so the same life can be experienced at different granularities:
- **Detailed** — plan every week and ride every lap. For players who want to live one career for years.
- **Key Moments** — routine weeks are auto-lived by the sim (sensible activity choices, low-importance events auto-resolved); the game only pauses for high-importance decisions and races. For players who want the story beats without the busywork.
- **Fast Sim** — the whole span auto-plays and returns a digest + recap. For players who want to run many careers to explore different lives and decisions.

In addition, a **Skip Ahead** control (skip to next race / auto-sim N weeks) is available during play regardless of depth, and each race can be **ridden lap-by-lap or auto-simmed**. Importance thresholds (from the Memory Engine's importance score) decide what a given depth pauses for.  
**Reason:** Player intent varies widely — "just work through the important decisions," "skip five years," "decide everything myself," "one career for a decade," "thirty careers to explore choices." Pacing should be a player-owned dial, not a fixed cadence, without changing the underlying simulation. Reuses the existing importance score rather than inventing a parallel system.  
**Status:** Proposed
